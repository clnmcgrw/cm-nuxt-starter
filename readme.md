# Colin's Nuxt Starter Template

---

This is meant to kick-start interactive marketing site development with Nuxt, it comes with more opinionated boilerplate:

* vuex store enabled with a base state containing things like screen size, mouse position, scroll position, etc.
* config'd to [import sass partials across components](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/1092) with sass-resources-loader
* example of vue-meta usage with page components
* example page transitions with anime.js
