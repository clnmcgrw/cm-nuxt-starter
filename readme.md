# Colin's Nuxt Starter Template

This is meant to kick-start marketing/brochure site development with Nuxt, it comes with more boilerplate like:

* example of vue-meta usage with page components
* config'd to [import sass variables across components](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/1092) (no import'ing to each component!)
* example page transitions with anime.js
* vuex store enabled with a base state containing things like screen size, scroll position, etc
* a ton of useful components
